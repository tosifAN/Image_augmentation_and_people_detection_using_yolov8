Image Augmentation Libraries Evaluation

Library Evaluation:
Explored various image augmentation libraries like Imgaug, Albumentations, SOLT, and Tensor.
After comprehensive testing, opted for SOLT due to its user-friendly nature and superior output quality.

Dataset Labeling Process

Labeling Method:
Utilized the 'labelimg' library for labeling the dataset.
Ensured accurate and comprehensive labeling of images for subsequent training.

Dataset Creation
Dataset Formation:
Completed the dataset creation process, incorporating augmented images via SOLT.
The finalized dataset includes labeled and augmented images ready for training.

Model Training in Colab
Training Environment:
Developed a Colab notebook for training the model based on the prepared dataset.
Conducted model training, validation, and optimization using the created dataset.

Model Testing on Images and Videos
Inference Results:
Applied the trained model to test images and videos.
Recorded and documented the model's performance and results in the 'inference' folder for further analysis.

This documentation outlines the stages involved in creating and preparing the image dataset, including the evaluation of augmentation libraries, dataset labeling, creation, model training in Colab, and subsequent testing on images and videos. It highlights the selected methods and tools used at each step, facilitating clarity and understanding of the dataset preparation and model training process. Adjustments can be made to suit the specific details and requirements of the workflow.
